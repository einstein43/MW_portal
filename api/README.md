# API Folder - Express.js with TypeScript

## Summary of Recent Work
(Updated April 16, 2025)

Recent development on the API backend has focused on:
- Implementation of user authentication system with middleware protection
- Development of a layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories)
- Creation of user management endpoints (registration, login, profile)
- Implementation of secure token-based authentication
- Integration with the frontend application for seamless data flow

## Setup Summary

The API was configured with the following components and features:

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **TypeScript**: Static type-checking and modern JavaScript features
- **Configuration**: TypeScript compiler options optimized for Node.js backend
- **Layered Architecture**: Structured codebase with Auth, Controller, Service, and Repository layers

## Architecture Overview

The API follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **Auth/Routes Layer**: Handles routing and authentication of API endpoints
   - Defines available routes and protects sensitive operations
   - Manages user authentication state

2. **Controller Layer**: Manages HTTP requests and responses
   - Processes incoming HTTP requests
   - Calls appropriate service methods
   - Formats and sends HTTP responses

3. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic
   - Implements core application functionality
   - Performs validation and business rules
   - Coordinates data operations

4. **Repository Layer**: Handles database communication
   - Abstracts data storage operations
   - Provides CRUD operations for data entities
   - Isolates the application from database implementation details

This separation of concerns improves code maintainability, testability, and reusability.
